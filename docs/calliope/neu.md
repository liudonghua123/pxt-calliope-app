# Choosing the right template for Calliope mini

No matter which version of Calliope mini you have or whether you’re programming on a mobile device or PC, you can always create a **`|New Project|`** and start programming.

If you’re using a Calliope mini 2, we suggest to use the optimized template **`|input:Calliope mini 2.x|`**. This allows you to transfer programs faster via Bluetooth and create more complex programs, due to partial flashing and a full usage of the available RAM. The settings loaded with the **`|input:Calliope mini 2.x|`** template can also be activated in any existing project through the settings menu. 

If you encounter issues with the default template (**`|functions:Calliope mini 1.x|`** or **`|New Project|`**) and your Calliope mini freezes, it may be due to limited available program memory (RAM). To free up more memory for your program we suggest switching on “Manual Bluetooth activation”. In this case each time you transfer programs you have to set the Calliope mini into Bluetooth mode. To do this, perform the “brace grip”: hold down buttons **`A`** and **`B`**, briefly tap the **`Reset`** button, and continue holding **`A`** and **`B`** until the pattern appears on the LED matrix.

## Additional Notes for iOS Users:

**We recommend that every user of the Calliope mini 2.x updates their device with the Demo Program once.**

If you have previously programmed your Calliope mini with another editor or flashed it with the last **`|input:Calliope mini 2.x|`** template, you cannot transfer the default project template directly from mobile. The Bluetooth settings have changed in this template, so one of the following steps is necessary so that you can transfer your program to mobile devices without any problems:

### Option A: Load program 25 (Demo Program):
To load the Program with the number **`25`** onto your Calliope mini, follow these steps:
1. Press and hold the reset button on your Calliope mini for approximately 5 seconds until all LEDs briefly light up and then turn off.
2. Press the **`A`** button to go back one step. This will illuminate the 25th LED on the display.
3. Press the **`A`** and **`B`** buttons simultaneously to confirm your selection and load Program 25. This process also resolves any other transfer issues. Once completed, your Calliope mini will be restored to its default state.

### Option B: Load the Demo Program:
In the Calliope mini app, navigate to the **`Editors and Programs`** section and locate the **`Start Program`** option. Load this program onto your Calliope mini, and you’ll be able to use the standard project template without any concerns.
